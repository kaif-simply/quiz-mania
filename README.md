## Problem Statement

This project is a quiz-based application where users can answer questions, select topics, and receive feedback based on their performance. The goal is to design an interactive quiz with different topics, display questions with multiple options, and calculate the score once the quiz is completed. Additionally, the user should be able to see feedback based on their performance, including correct, incorrect, and skipped answers.

## Completed Features

- Displaying a list of questions with multiple-choice options.
- Keeping track of correct, incorrect, and skipped answers.
- Showing a score percentage at the end of the quiz.
- Handling user interactions for selecting topics, answering questions, and viewing results.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
